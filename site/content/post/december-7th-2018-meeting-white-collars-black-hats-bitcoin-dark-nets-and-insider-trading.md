We know criminal hacking is big business, over the past decade, we have seen criminal syndicates get creative with ways of generating revenue, through markets selling stolen credit cards, selling of tools and services and more recently ransomware. With the rise of popularity in Bitcoin, there has been an increasing interest from those in the financial sector in the pseudo-anonymous currency as well as underground markets and sites sharing information via hidden services in the Tor network and other platforms. Financially savvy white collar criminals now have increased access to criminal hackers who can target, steal and share nonpublic data about companies, this paired with the anonymous nature of hidden services and Bitcoin reduces the risk of getting caught, but with large financial gains. In this talk we will review several cases where criminals have gained millions of dollars through compromising PR and legal firms and steps these organizations can take to protect this data.
